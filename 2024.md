  <p>PVABRA is an eBay store primarily selling graphic terminals and other refurbished electronics. The main goal for this branding was to have something that is recognizable as relating to the electronics industry while remaining distinct from the branding of other similar eBay stores and graphic terminal manufacturers (particularly Allen Bradley).</p>

The [Sequential Artists Workshop](https://www.sequentialartistsworkshop.org) hosts a Gainesville-based emerging artists residency, primarily focused on the creation of different forms of sequential art (or simply put, comics). I was not only lucky enough to participate in their program, able to use their studio space at my leisure for creative endeavors, but I was also given the opportunity to host a community event. I demonstrated the tools and skills necessary to use (and get used to) Adobe Illustrator in a casual, hands-on manner as participatnts created their own rendition of the above rendering of a sardine can.

_The vector illustration is an original design._

## Doyle Grove -- Branding

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/VNGxp5X.png)

I designed branding assets (logo and visual identity) for a hypothetical fruit orchard and juice distributor. The purpose of this visual identity was to distinguish the company from a competitor that uses a more modernistic layout, higher-contrast colors, and photographic depictions of fruit while simultaneously communicating the small family business values of the company.

_This design features original hand lettering and the mock-up was created in Adobe Dimension._
