I was tasked with creating marketing material for the annual UF WARPhaus spring exhibition, which showcases that semester's cohort's (generally comprised of freshmen) work. These showcases have proven to be grandiose and eclectic, with my cohort being no different. We presented pieces that explored the concept of materiality by means of both material and immaterial mediums and subjects.

## UF Russian Culture Club -- Merchandise

In close collaboration with 2022's executive board, our aim was to create a design that not only filled a somewhat obligatory "club merch" quota that is befitting of nearly all university student organizations, but was also something that people would genuinely want to purchase and wear in their day to day. We decided on a Slavic folklore/storybook theme, featuring an illustration of a Firebird, a mythical creature appearing in many iconic Slavic fairy tales.
