Treasure Planet is a childhood staple for a lot of kids born in the 90's and early 2000's ... but did you know that it actually lost Disney millions of dollars and has next to nothing in terms of merchandise to commemorate its run? As a hypothetical, I designed some T-shirts that may have been sold at the time of the movie coming out, utilizing iconography from the movie and keeping to an early 2000's aesthetic.

When designing social media graphics, it is very important to balance both brevity and invitation to prolonged audience engagement. By creating a first "hook" illustrated image, we are able to pique the audience's curiosity, as well as establish a strong visual identity for the event. The actual informational image that follows holds all of the necessary details, which are easier for the audience to recall when paired with the initial memorable graphic.
