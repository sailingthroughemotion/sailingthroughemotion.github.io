# 2024

### My junior year resumed with new experimental design studios and continued involvement in extracurricular design projects, such as my residency and a new round of Russian Culture Club merchandise.

## Doyle Grove

This was a project intended to challenge students in their branding capabilities, as well as making a mock-up in Adobe Dimension. Along with that, I took it as an opportunity to explore hand-drawn type. [Click here to take a look into the design process.](./process_doylegrove.md)

## UF Russian Culture Club Merchandise

Returning for my third year in a row, and with a decided theme of Space Race propaganda posters, this was the 2024 iteration of the club's merchandise -- available on shirts and bumper stickers. [Click here to take a look at some variations.](./detail_russianclub24.md)

## SAW Emerging Artists Residency Skill Share

As part of my residency, it was mandatory that I contribute some sort of public offering -- be it a workshop, a demo, or a studio tour. Given my extensive experience, I decided to do a skill-share on Adoobe Illustrator. Participants would follow along as we made an illustration together, getting accustomed to the overall layout and functions of basic (but nevertheless extremely useful!) tools.
