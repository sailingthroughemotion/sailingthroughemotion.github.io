# 2023

### During the second semester of my sophomore year, with a gracious schedule, I was able to invest more time into my specialty with an initial focus into client work. 

### The first semester of my junior year, I was enriched once more into multiple graphic design studios where I could stretch my creative muscles in typography and branding exercises.

## UF Russian Culture Club Merchandise 
Although my schedule prevented me from participating in any club activities my sophomore year, I was still happy to contribute to my beloved club with a fresh set of merchandise! These were inspired by the Soviet cartoons, "Cheburashka" and "Just You Wait!".

## The Titanic Comedy Open Mic
This was a commissioned work of a promotional flyer for a comedy event. In creating advertisements for social media, I am a strong contender for striking people's curiousity to swipe through image sets by creating an interesting "hook" as a cover image.

## Damned If I Do
This was a semi-autobiographical project with the prompt to combine two disparate texts. In this case, the two passages were a few lines from Zemfira's *Hochesh*, which, rougly translated, read: "Please don't die, or I'll have to, too. You'll of course go straight to heaven, but I'm not sure that I will, too." and [Twitter users's SICKOFWOLVES poignant post](https://twitter.com/SICKOFWOLVES/status/1356294995246940160).
