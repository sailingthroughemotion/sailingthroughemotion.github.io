### The second semester of my sophomore year, with a gracious schedule, I was able to invest more time into my specialty with an initial focus into client work.

## UF Russian Culture Club Merchandise 
Although my schedule prevented me from participating in any club activities my sophomore year, I was still happy to contribute to my beloved club with a fresh set of merchandise! These were inspired by the Soviet cartoons, "Cheburashka" and "Just You Wait!".
