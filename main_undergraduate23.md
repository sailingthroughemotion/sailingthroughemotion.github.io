# 2022

### The second semester of my sophomore year, with a gracious schedule, I was able to invest more time into my specialty with an initial focus into client work.

## UF Russian Culture Club Merchandise 
Although my schedule prevented me from participating in any club activities my sophomore year, I was still happy to contribute to my beloved club with a fresh set of merchandise! These were inspired by the Soviet cartoons, "Cheburashka" and "Just You Wait!".

## The Titanic Comedy Open Mic
This was a commissioned work of a promotional flyer for a comedy event. In creating advertisements for social media, I am a strong contender for striking people's curiousity to swipe through image sets by creating an interesting "hook" as a cover image.
