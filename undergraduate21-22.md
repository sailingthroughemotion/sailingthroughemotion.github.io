# 2021-22

### Freshman year is the crown year of portfolio-building, and it was no different for me, starting August 2021. I got the chance to get my first real taste of actionable graphic design.

## Post-Soviet Heart
This was a digital collage for an asssignment conveying deep and shallow space. Largely abstract and emotional, both parts of these echo the messy, conflicting feelings between my nationality and my sexuality.

## Dysfunctional Creatures of the 5th Dimension
A very light-hearted projected, the most challenging part of which was creating 50 unique body parts to mix and match until the final three monsters were manifested. The amusing science-fiction approach to the presentation was largely inspired by the creative project _Mystery Flesh Pit National Park_.

## 70's Icon Set
The warmly-colored final poster was just the icing on the cake prior to having to create a set of 12 icons which were then published to the Noun Project. You can find some of them [here](https://thenounproject.com/ulianachem2021/).

## Radical Feminist T-Shirt
Another project which touched on personal interests and concerns, we were given a prompt to design a T-shirt that showcased a message for something that we wished society could achieve within the next X years. As an avid proponent of radical feminism, I took inspiration from the colorful aesthetics of second-wave feminism, such as the Michigan Womyn's Festival.

## ... and what were we expecting to find down there?
Drawing from Avery Singer's contemporary themes of meme culture and odd, tiled spaces, this digital painting is an ode to the absurdist tumblr meme of the [plinko horse](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/horse-plinko), and the nature of habitual, endless scrolling of social media.

## Russian Culture Club Merchandise
I was actively involved in UF's Russian Culture Club and was given the chance to create a new design for some cool merch. This design was printed on a few dozen crewneck sweatshirts. It depicts the words "Russian Club", with a firebird -- a common mythical creature in Slavic folklore.

## What I Can Touch
This poster was part of the advertising campaign for the 2022 WARPhaus spring exhibition. The social media post version can be found [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcMADi6lukd/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=).
