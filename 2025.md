Answering the call to address the lack of art-making spaces in Gainesville, "Palette Riot" is a fictional guerilla architectural firm that advocates for the creation of shared art spaces and galleries for local multidisciplinary artists. This project was a collaborative effort with [Katelynn Meggison](https://katelynnmeg25.wixstudio.com/katelynnmeggison).

_The Palette Riot title logo features an original hand lettered font._
