Drew is an Astrophysics major that wanted a monochrome tattoo to remember the good times working on his undergraduate research. Heâ€™s getting the main tattoo across his forearm, and him and a few of his buddies whom he did a summer internship with are getting matching smaller tattoos to commemorate their work at the Rosemary Hill Observatory.

_These designs feature hand-drawn and manually constructed vector illustrations, as well as a hand-lettering._

Answering the call to address the lack of art-making spaces in Gainesville, "Palette Riot" is a fictional guerilla architectural firm that advocates for the creation of shared art spaces and galleries for local multidisciplinary artists. This project was a collaborative effort with [Katelynn Meggison](https://katelynnmeg25.wixstudio.com/katelynnmeggison).

_The Palette Riot title logo features an original hand-lettered font._
