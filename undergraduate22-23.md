# 2022-23

### I started my sophomore year early in May of 2022 and focused primarily on typographic and explorative digital work during the summer.

## A Girl and a Black Pegasus
Somewhere between the ages of 16 and 19, I was thoroughly burnt out on creative art that was done solely for my own enjoyment. 2022 spurred my journey of rediscovering my love for the process, and with it, came many self-indulgent studies and paintings, such as this one.

## I've Seen You
What started as a simple exercise to showcase Photoshop's masking and filter capabilities, became a love-letter to my own emotions fueled by the art of [Arai Sumiko](https://twitter.com/agu_knzm?s=20&t=bSs-2HtKaeroDNVMrFUCFg).

## Мы не художники если мы не страдаем
"If you're happy, then how can you be an artist? All artists have to be suffering from something," my mother once told me. This experimental, vintage-syle zine is a composite of a few artists (musical or otherwise) and/or historical figures that speak to the incessant inspiration from women that either speak or stand as proponents of female homosexual love. Click the image below to see the full zine.

## Gainesville Ice Arena
For a small college town, Gainesville has pretty much everything a casual citizen could wish for. However, spoiled by most of our life having been spent in large cities, it's a shame that we don't have an ice rink -- it would be a nice change of pace during the overbearing Florida summer. This isn't a real event, but it would certainly be nice.

## T1D: All the Things They Never Told Me
When prompted to create an "instructional zine", I struggled to come up with something that I could definitively say I specialized in. However, there is one thing that I've had a wealth of personal experience with -- my own type one diabetes. Click the image below to see the full zine.

## Fantasy Perspective Study 
The summer of '22 was spent primarily on campus, but the creative time I had at home wasn't wasted either. Investing in Marc Brunet's ART School courses, I began working on seriously studying the technical aspects of digital art through his well-crafted lessons and exercises.

## Mejiro McQueen Fan-Art
How better to apply the digital art techniques I'd begun to pick up than use the framework of an already-existing character? Mejiro McQueen is one of the main characters of the second season of _Uma Musume: Pretty Derby_.
