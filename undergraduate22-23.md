# 2022-23

### I started my sophomore year early in May of 2022 and focused primarily on typographic and explorative digital work.

##A Girl and a Black Pegasus
Somewhere between the ages of 16 and 19, I was thoroughly burnt out on creative art that was done solely for my own enjoyment. 2022 spurred my journey of rediscovering my love for the process, and with it, came many self-indulgent studies and paintings, such as this one.

## I've Seen You
What started as a simple exercise to showcase Photoshop's masking and filter capabilities, became a love-letter to my own emotions fueled by the art of [Arai Sumiko](https://twitter.com/agu_knzm?s=20&t=bSs-2HtKaeroDNVMrFUCFg).

## Мы не художники если мы не страдаем
"If you're happy, then how can you be an artist? All artists have to be suffering from something," my mother once told me. This experimental, vintage-syle zine is a composite of a few artists (musical or otherwise) and/or historical figures that speak to the incessant inspiration from women that either speak or stand as proponents of female homosexual love.
