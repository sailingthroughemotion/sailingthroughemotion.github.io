### I started my sophomore year early in May of 2022 and focused primarily on typographic and explorative digital work during the summer.

## I've Seen You
What started as a simple exercise to showcase Photoshop's masking and filter capabilities, became a love-letter to my own emotions fueled by the art of [Arai Sumiko](https://twitter.com/agu_knzm?s=20&t=bSs-2HtKaeroDNVMrFUCFg).

## Мы не художники если мы не страдаем
"If you're happy, then how can you be an artist? All artists have to be suffering from something," my mother once told me. This experimental, vintage-syle zine is a composite of a few artists (musical or otherwise) and/or historical figures that speak to the incessant inspiration from women that either speak or stand as proponents of female homosexual love.

## Gainesville Ice Arena
For a small college town, Gainesville has pretty much everything a casual citizen could wish for. However, spoiled by most of our life having been spent in large cities, it's a shame that we don't have an ice rink -- it would be a nice change of pace during the overbearing Florida summer. This isn't a real event, but it would certainly be nice.

## T1D: All the Things They Never Told Me
When prompted to create an "instructional zine", I struggled to come up with something that I could definitively say I specialized in. However, there is one thing that I've had a wealth of personal experience with -- my own type one diabetes. Click the image below to see the full zine.
