# About Me

*Who are you?*

I’m a freelance graphic designer and digital artist currently pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design at the University of Florida. At present, I’m on my third year of study. In addition to the formal academic degree, I am working on obtaining a certification from Marc Brunet’s [ART School](http://cbr.sh/eqcb55).

*Why graphic design?*

It is one thing to be able to draw to depict, but what does it mean to truly have a good eye? To pick up on the evocative elements of a composition without so much as touching the subject matter is such a magical moment — to be able to recognize not why we’re looking, but why we *looked*. So, then — how could it not be graphic design?
