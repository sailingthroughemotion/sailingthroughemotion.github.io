For my fourth and final year as a member of UF's Russian Culture Club, I created a design featuring two bears (common iconography associated with Slavic countries) playing a card game called "durak". 

This design features original hand-drawn illustrations, as well as original hand lettering.

  <p>PVABRA is an eBay store primarily selling graphic terminals and other refurbished electronics. The main goal for this branding was to have something that is recognizable as relating to the electronics industry while remaining distinct from the branding of other similar eBay stores and graphic terminal manufacturers (particularly Allen Bradley).</p>

This design features referenced manually constructed vector illustrations.

The [Sequential Artists Workshop](https://www.sequentialartistsworkshop.org) hosts a Gainesville-based emerging artists residency, primarily focused on the creation of different forms of sequential art (or simply put, comics). I was not only lucky enough to participate in their program, able to use their studio space at my leisure for creative endeavors, but I was also given the opportunity to host a community event. I demonstrated the tools and skills necessary to use (and get used to) Adobe Illustrator in a casual, hands-on manner as participatnts created their own rendition of the above rendering of a sardine can.

The vector illustration is an original design.

Reprising my unofficial role as the merchandise designer for the UF Russian Culture Club for the third year in a row, the club's executive team and I came together to present these two Soviet space race-themed designs for our fellow members. 

_Although the final illustrattion here appears as black on white, the final product was a white design on a black T-shirt, but it is presented in its initial black on white iteration for better screen legibility._

This design features original and referenced hand-drawn illustrations, as well as original hand lettering.

## The Titanic Comedy Open Mic 2023

This design features a referenced manually constructed vector illustration.

When designing social media graphics, it is very important to balance both brevity and invitation to prolonged audience engagement. By creating a first "hook" illustratie image, we are able to pique the audience's curiosity, as well as establish a strong visual identity for the event. The actual informational image that follows holds all of the necessary details, which are easier for the audience to recall when paired with the initial memorable graphic.

The club's executive board and I decided that 2023's theme would be something light-hearted, yet still distinctly recognizable for almost any young adult that has grown up with Soviet and/or post-Soviet culture. As such, we decided to include characters from the Soviet cartoons "Just You Wait!" and "Cheburashka" on T-shirts and beanie hats, respectively.

These designs feature referenced hand-drawn illustrations, as well as hand-drawn type referencing the style of the Cyrillic title of "Just You Wait".

I was tasked with creating marketing material for the annual UF WARPhaus spring exhibition, which showcases that semester's cohort's (generally comprised of freshmen) work. These showcases have proven to be grandiose and eclectic, with my cohort being no different. We presented pieces that explored the concept of materiality by means of both material and immaterial mediums and subjects.

## UF Russian Culture Club -- Merchandise 2021/22

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cTvFNbj.png)

In close collaboration with 2022's executive board, our aim was to create a design that not only filled a somewhat obligatory "club merch" quota that is befitting of nearly all university student organizations, but was also something that people would genuinely want to purchase and wear in their day to day. We decided on a Slavic folklore/storybook theme, featuring an illustration of a Firebird, a mythical creature appearing in many iconic Slavic fairy tales.

This design features original hand-drawn illustration.
