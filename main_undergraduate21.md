# 2021

### First semester of freshman year is the crown year of portfolio-building, and it was no different for me, starting August 2021. I got the chance to get my first real taste of actionable graphic design.

## Post-Soviet Heart
This was a digital collage for an asssignment conveying deep and shallow space. Largely abstract and emotional, both parts of these echo the messy, conflicting feelings between my nationality and my sexuality.

## Dysfunctional Creatures of the 5th Dimension
A very light-hearted projected, the most challenging part of which was creating 50 unique body parts to mix and match until the final three monsters were manifested. The amusing science-fiction approach to the presentation was largely inspired by the creative project _Mystery Flesh Pit National Park_.

## 70's Icon Set
The warmly-colored final poster was just the icing on the cake prior to having to create a set of 12 icons which were then published to the Noun Project. You can find some of them [here](https://thenounproject.com/ulianachem2021/).

## Radical Feminist T-Shirt
Another project which touched on personal interests and concerns, we were given a prompt to design a T-shirt that showcased a message for something that we wished society could achieve within the next X years. As an avid proponent of radical feminism, I took inspiration from the colorful aesthetics of second-wave feminism, such as the Michigan Womyn's Festival.
