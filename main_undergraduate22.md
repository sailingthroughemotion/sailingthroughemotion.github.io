# 2022

### My freshman year wrapped up with some more ambitious academically-affiliated projects and then I started my sophomore year early in May of 2022 and focused primarily on typographic and explorative digital work during the summer.

## ... and what were we expecting to find down there?
Drawing from Avery Singer's contemporary themes of meme culture and odd, tiled spaces, this digital painting is an ode to the absurdist tumblr meme of the [plinko horse](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/horse-plinko), and the nature of habitual, endless scrolling of social media.

## Russian Culture Club Merchandise
I was actively involved in UF's Russian Culture Club and was given the chance to create a new design for some cool merch. This design was printed on a few dozen crewneck sweatshirts. It depicts the words "Russian Club", with a firebird -- a common mythical creature in Slavic folklore.

## What I Can Touch
This poster was part of the advertising campaign for the 2022 WARPhaus spring exhibition. The social media post version can be found [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcOE29OOuhr/).

## I've Seen You
What started as a simple exercise to showcase Photoshop's masking and filter capabilities, became a love-letter to my own emotions fueled by the art of [Arai Sumiko](https://twitter.com/agu_knzm?s=20&t=bSs-2HtKaeroDNVMrFUCFg).

## Мы не художники если мы не страдаем
"If you're happy, then how can you be an artist? All artists have to be suffering from something," my mother once told me. This experimental, vintage-syle zine is a composite of a few artists (musical or otherwise) and/or historical figures that speak to the incessant inspiration from women that either speak or stand as proponents of female homosexual love. Click the image below to see the full zine.

## Gainesville Ice Arena
For a small college town, Gainesville has pretty much everything a casual citizen could wish for. However, spoiled by most of our life having been spent in large cities, it's a shame that we don't have an ice rink -- it would be a nice change of pace during the overbearing Florida summer. This isn't a real event, but it would certainly be nice. [Click here to take a look into the creation process.](./process_icerink.md)

## Lunatic Lesbians Anonymous
Just a personal creative exercise, imagining a fun congregation of fellow lesbians with eclectic interests.
