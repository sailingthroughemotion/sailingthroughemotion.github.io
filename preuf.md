This drawing was done in PaintToolSAI in 2017. It was the first piece I'd made which showed development of my sense of dimension and lighting.

While the community surrounding anthropormophic animals holds a rather infamous position within internet culture, it provided with me an excellent opportunity to experiment with character design, anatomy, and texture, while still maintaining my comfort with drawing equine features.

Directly referencing a screenshot from the 1999 film, _But I'm a Cheerleader_, I had begun to push PaintToolSAI to its limits as a painting software, trying to understand the technical gesture which went into a convincing brushstroke and the color theory within atmospheric scenes.
