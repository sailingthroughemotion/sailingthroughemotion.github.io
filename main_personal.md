# Individual Experiments, Studies, and Passion Projects

### As much as I am dedicated to the field of graphic design, drawing will always be my first and inseperable mistress. Here, I will be keeping track of personal digital works, derivative and original.

## Go For a Swim?
While the community surrounding anthropormophic animals holds a rather infamous position within internet culture, it provided with me an excellent opportunity to experiment with character design, anatomy, and texture, while still maintaining my comfort with drawing equine features.

## Screenshot Study
Directly referencing a screenshot from the 1999 film, _But I'm a Cheerleader_, I had begun to push PaintToolSAI to its limits as a painting software, trying to understand the technical gesture which went into a convincing brushstroke and the color theory within atmospheric scenes.

## A Girl and a Black Pegasus
Somewhere between the ages of 16 and 19, I was thoroughly burnt out on creative art that was done solely for my own enjoyment. 2022 spurred my journey of rediscovering my love for the process, and with it, came many self-indulgent studies and paintings, such as this one.

## Fantasy Perspective Study 
The summer of '22 was spent primarily on campus, but the creative time I had at home wasn't wasted either. Investing in Marc Brunet's ART School courses, I began working on seriously studying the technical aspects of digital art through his well-crafted lessons and exercises.

## Mejiro McQueen Fan-Art
How better to apply the digital art techniques I'd begun to pick up than use the framework of an already-existing character? Mejiro McQueen is one of the main characters of the second season of _Uma Musume: Pretty Derby_.

## Air Shakur x Sirius Symboli Fan-Art
The _Uma Musume: Pretty Derby_ took a good hold on me during the summer of 2022 and well into the fall as well, but a hyperfixation for an artist is nothing more than an excuse to see how we can push our existing and newfound techniques to the limit. In this work, I tried my hand at a flatter rendering style, as well as more acute color-picking rather than relying on layer blending modes.
